# Store

One of the projects I completed towards the begining of my course work at Eleven Fifty Coding Academy was to build a static web page 
advertising a store or some place of business using only HTML and CSS elements.  Althought this project does not have any real programming
behind it, I believe it demonstrates the fair knowledge of HTML and CSS I had at the begining of my course work.
